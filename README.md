## Inspiration 💡

This tool pays homage to Hiroshi Kawano, Japan’s pioneering figure in computer art.<br>
As a philosopher and aesthetician, Kawano did not view art merely as a product of intuition, but as a manifestation of logic and formal systems.<br>
By applying symbolic logic and generative rules to visual structures, he redefined art as an exploration of computational beauty — where meaning arises from order, symmetry, and transformation.

> “美とは、構造に内在する秩序である。” — *川野 洋*

Through this tool, users can engage with that vision — crafting abstract patterns governed not by emotion, but by algorithmic intent.
